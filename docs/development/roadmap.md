### 1. **Project Setup & State Management**

- **Project Structure:**  
  - Use a React (or Next.js) project written in TypeScript.
  - Organize folders into components, pages, state (Redux slices), services (for API calls), hooks (for WebSocket management), and utilities.

- **State Management:**  
  - **Redux Toolkit:** Create slices for each major domain:
    - **Shopping List Slice:** CRUD operations, collaborator updates, and price comparison state.
    - **Recipe Slice:** Recipe data, comments/ratings, meal planning, nutritional info.
    - **Notification Slice:** In-app notification state, user preferences, and status tracking.
    - **Map Slice:** Stores and location data, distances.
  - **RTK Query:** Use this for API data caching and automatic re-fetching. This helps reduce boilerplate for calling your endpoints.
  - **React Context:** For simpler global states (e.g., theme, language) that don’t require Redux.

### 2. **API Service Layer**

- **Endpoint Integration:**  
  - Create a dedicated API service module (using Axios or fetch) that defines functions corresponding to each backend endpoint (e.g., `getRecipes()`, `createShoppingList()`, `getNotifications()`, etc.).
  - For each service:
    - **Shopping List:** Functions for list CRUD, collaborator management, and price comparison endpoints.
    - **Recipe Service:** Functions for recipe CRUD, comments/ratings, meal planning, and nutritional info.
    - **Map Service:** Functions for fetching store locations and distance calculations.
    - **Notification Service:** Functions to fetch and update notifications across channels.
  - **Authentication:**  
    - Ensure each API call attaches the JWT token.
    - Handle errors (e.g., token expiry) in a centralized interceptor.

### 3. **WebSocket Integration for Real-Time Updates**

- **Connection Management:**  
  - Create a custom hook (e.g., `useWebSocket`) to:
    - Open and maintain a WebSocket connection.
    - Listen for messages (e.g., list updates, notifications) and dispatch actions to update Redux state.
    - Handle reconnection logic and message queuing for smooth real-time communication.

### 4. **Component & Page Development**

#### **Phase 1: Core Shopping Features (Week 3-4)**
- **Shopping List Components:**  
  - **List View:** Create a component to display shopping lists (using grid or list layout).
  - **Item CRUD:** Components for adding, editing, and deleting items.  
  - **Collaborator UI:** Buttons or modals to invite and manage collaborators.
  - **Price Comparison:** Show store-specific pricing and analytics.

#### **Phase 2: Recipe Management (Week 5-6)**
- **Recipe Page:**  
  - Display recipe details (title, images, ingredients, instructions, nutritional info).
  - Include social interactions: comments (with nested threads and sorting options), likes, ratings.
  - **Menu Options:** “Add to recipes,” “Remix recipe,” “Export to text,” “See who saved the recipe,” and “Report recipe.”
- **Meal Planning:**  
  - Calendar view or list view for planning recipes.
  - Toggle between recipe view and ingredient list.

#### **Phase 3: Location & Maps (Week 7-8)**
- **Map Components:**  
  - **Store Locator:** Display stores with their logos and deals on a map.
  - **Distance Calculation:** Visual cues for proximity (e.g., pins or distance markers).
  - **Integration:** Use Google Maps API (or similar) to render the map and filter by location.

#### **Additional Interactive Features**
- **Real-time Notifications:**  
  - A notification panel that shows alerts from the Notification Service.
  - Update state via WebSocket messages.
- **Cooking View:**  
  - A horizontally oriented view for step-by-step instructions with checkboxes.
  - Integrate timers for each cooking step.
- **Social & Profile Pages:**  
  - Design user profiles similar to Instagram (recipe grid, follower/following count, DM, story highlights).
- **Smart Filtering:**  
  - A dedicated filtering sidebar or modal that allows advanced filtering options (cuisines, dietary, time, etc.) as described in the UI/UX guide.

---

### 5. **Integration Timeline & Final Polish (Week 9-10)**
- **Integration:**  
  - Connect all the components with the API service layer and Redux.
  - Ensure that WebSocket events update state in real time.
- **Polish:**  
  - Implement error handling and loading states in each component.
  - Optimize performance with lazy loading (code splitting) and virtual scrolling for long lists.
  - Ensure secure token handling in your API service layer.
- **Testing:**  
  - Write integration and E2E tests (using tools like Cypress or Playwright) to simulate real user flows.
  - Focus on key flows like logging in, searching, adding to shopping lists, and interacting with recipes.

---

### 6. **Security & Performance Considerations**
- **JWT Management:**  
  - Use secure storage for tokens (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or secure local storage).
- **WebSocket Security:**  
  - Secure your connection using WSS and ensure authentication on the connection.
- **Optimistic UI Updates:**  
  - For actions like adding an item to a list, update the UI immediately and reconcile with backend responses.
- **Caching & Debouncing:**  
  - Use RTK Query’s caching capabilities and debounce search/filter inputs to improve performance.

---

### **Real-World Inspirations**
- **Instagram & Smakshare:** For user profiles and interactive recipe pages.
- **Reddit:** For nested comments and sorting.
- **SoundCloud:** For the explore page design and smooth filtering.
- **Instacart:** For shopping list and price comparison functionalities.
- **Strava:** For real-time tracking and social interactions.
