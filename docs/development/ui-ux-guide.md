# Rezepta Features: UI/UX Designer's Guide

This guide explains the backend features from a UI/UX perspective, helping you understand what needs to be designed and why.

## Core Search Experience

### Basic Search
The search system is designed to help users find recipes quickly and accurately:
- Users can search using natural language (e.g., "spicy chicken soup")
- The system prioritizes matches in recipe titles over descriptions
- Typo tolerance is built in (e.g., "spageti" will still find "spaghetti")
- Search works across multiple fields (title, ingredients, instructions)

### Advanced Filtering
Users need intuitive ways to narrow down their search results:
