### [TS-001] Express Async Route Handler Type Limitations

**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: TypeScript Types  
**Created**: 2024-01-22

#### Description
Express's type system has limitations with async route handlers returning Response objects. This is a known issue in the DefinitelyTyped repository (see: [DefinitelyTyped#50871](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/50871)).

Currently affecting:
- `src/routes/social/achievements.ts`
- Any other route files using async handlers with response objects

#### Current Workaround
We're using type assertions (`as RequestHandler`) to bypass the type checking. This is safe as we're properly handling all error cases and responses, but it's not an ideal solution from a type safety perspective.

#### Impact
- TypeScript shows type errors for valid code
- Need to use type assertions
- Reduced type safety for route handlers

#### Potential Solutions
1. **Short-term**:
   - Continue using type assertions with proper documentation
   - Create a custom wrapper function for async route handlers

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Create a custom middleware type definition
   - Implement a proper async router wrapper

3. **Long-term**:
   - Wait for Express to improve their type definitions
   - Consider migrating to a framework with better TypeScript support (e.g., NestJS)
   - Create our own Express-compatible router with proper TypeScript support

#### Notes
- The code works correctly at runtime
- All error cases are properly handled
- Type assertions are documented in the affected files
