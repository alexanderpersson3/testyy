# [Task] Improve Express Async Route Handler Type Safety

## Overview
We need to improve the type safety of our Express async route handlers. Currently, we're using `@ts-expect-error` comments as a workaround for Express's type system limitations.

## Status
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Due Date**: TBD (Dependent on Express type improvements)
- **Related Issue**: [TS-001](../ISSUES/TS-001-express-async-handlers.md)

## Success Criteria
1. All async route handlers have proper type safety without needing `@ts-expect-error` comments
2. No type assertions needed for request/response objects
3. Full IntelliSense support for route handler parameters
4. Proper error handling with type-safe error objects

## Action Items

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Create ESLint rule to enforce proper format for `@ts-expect-error` comments
- [ ] Add automated tests for all route handlers to ensure runtime safety
- [ ] Document current workaround in developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Set up monitoring for Express and DefinitelyTyped updates

### Phase 2: Custom Solution (1-2 months)
- [ ] Research and evaluate custom router solutions
- [ ] Create proof of concept for type-safe async router
- [ ] Implement custom middleware for better type inference
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for the new router

### Phase 3: Long-term Solution (3+ months)
- [ ] Evaluate migration to frameworks with better TypeScript support
- [ ] Create migration plan if needed
- [ ] Implement chosen solution
- [ ] Update all affected routes

## Dependencies
- Express type definition improvements
- TypeScript updates
- Team capacity for implementation

## Notes
- Monitor [DefinitelyTyped Issue #50871](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/50871)
- Consider NestJS as alternative if Express types aren't improved
- Ensure backward compatibility during any transitions
